# Handwriting notation

In this guideline I want to share simple notation for writing documentation or personal notes by hand on the paper, which I have unintentionally developed and currently practicing for a long time.

## Structure
I propose two approaches how to structure the working sheet:
* unstructured space
* structured space

### Unstructured space
The simplest structure of the text sheet, guess what, - no structure. That's right, whole piece of paper without devisions into blocks and compartments.\
It makes sense not to bother yourself with dividing working space for a relative small documents or the ones which dont require freequent and fast navigation. Without structure you use 100% of your working space for the data you want to capture. You also will be able to minimize free space waste. Tokens are located together with the data and are not separated using this structure


```

|-------- <-- 100% --> --------|

### Structured space
Structured space consists of **_token area_** and **_working area_**.


Token area location depends on the direction of your writing. If you are writing from left to right then your token area will be to the left, otherwise to the right respectfully. You pick token area widths by yourself depending on the variety of tokens in your vocabulary which most likely will be used together in the same line. The wider the area - more metainformation you can provide about your content but the price is loosing space for your data. Token area contains tokens which enrich lines of data with specific meaning. Being located at the beginning of a page they are easily noticeable and help to attract your attention to the reading entry points.
