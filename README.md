# Handwriting notation

In this guideline I want to share simple notation for writing documentation or personal notes by hand on the paper, which I have unintentionally developed and currently practicing for a long time.

## Structure
I propose two approaches how to structure the working sheet:
* unstructured space
* structured space

### Unstructured space
The simplest structure of the text sheet, guess what, - no structure. That's right, whole piece of paper without devisions into blocks and compartments.\
It makes sense not to bother yourself with dividing working space for a relative small documents or the ones which dont require freequent and fast navigation. Without structure you use 100% of your working space for the data you want to capture. You also will be able to minimize free space waste.
